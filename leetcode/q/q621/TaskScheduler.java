//Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, wher
//e each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Eac
//h task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complet
//e either one task or just be idle. 
//
// However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown perio
//d between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must
// be at least n units of time between any two same tasks. 
//
// Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish al
//l the given tasks. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
//Output: 8
//Explanation: 
//A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
//There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
//Output: 6
//Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
//["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
//["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
//["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
//...
//And so on.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
//Output: 16
//Explanation: 
//One possible solution is
//A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle ->
// idle -> A
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= task.length <= 104 
// tasks[i] is upper-case English letter. 
// The integer n is in the range [0, 100].
